# ðŸ§  Understand Neural Networks

This project aims to give clear and progressive explanations about how to use **PyTorch** to create different types of **Neural Networks**, from the simplest models to more advanced architectures.

Each Jupyter Notebook includes:

* commented **code examples**
* detailed **explanations** of every PyTorch method used
* a focus on the **mathematical concepts** behind them

Whether youâ€™re new to PyTorch or just want to better understand whatâ€™s happening under the hood, this repository is here to guide you step by step.

## ðŸ“˜ 1 - Following the Quickstart Section of PyTorch

Start with the [**Quickstart.ipynb**](./Quickstart.ipynb) notebook: itâ€™s the first one you should follow.

In it, I go through the official PyTorch quickstart example while explaining key concepts such as:

* the most common **loss functions**
* the different **optimizers**
* how **training** and **evaluation loops** really work under the hood.

Itâ€™s a great entry point to build a solid foundation before moving on to more complex models.

## ðŸš€ Coming Soon

More notebooks are on the way, covering:

* **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
* **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
* and many other core deep learning concepts.

A **French translation** of each notebook will also be available soon ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·

Stay tuned!
